                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Research is a tool for building knowledge and for facilitating learning. It plays a pivotal role in making universities competitive worldwide. Quality research enables universities to explore organizational and societal issues to identify or suggest solutions. It enables the educational sector to perform the systematic analysis while continuously improving our practices, thus develops refined understanding related to learning and teaching. With the aim of promoting and strengthening research culture in the university, Directorate of Research is working under Pro-Rector, University of Central Punjab. The role of the Directorate of Research is to primarily design, develop, manage, and control process of Research, in order to develop a stimulating research environment at UCP through which faculty members can build their profile and career around impact & market-oriented research. With this, faculty members play a critical role in attracting students towards research and image building of university through R&D activities. The Directorate is in communication with the Deans of all faculties. In order to facilitate faculty and students regarding conducting research, the directorate formulates new policies and updates the existing ones. It also manages to conduct training workshops to equip the faculty and students with advanced research skills. In addition, the directorate continuously monitors the research output of faculty members via its own state of the art research portal. Also, the faculty members who come out to be outstanding researchers are encouraged through a publication remuneration award.</p>
